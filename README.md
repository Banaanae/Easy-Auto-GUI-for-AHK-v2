#  'Easy AutoGUI' for AHK-v2
Easy AutoGUI for AHK-v2 is a modified version of Alguimist's 'Easy AutoGUI' GUI-Designer for basic and advanced creation.  

If you need help getting started, I put together an installer. [Direct Link](https://github.com/samfisherirl/Easy-Auto-GUI-for-AHK-v2/releases/download/v1.6.1/Easy_AutoGUI_v2_Installer.exe)


# Credits:
This project is built upon years of hard work done by the individuals below. I played a very small part in bringing this to AHKv2, these individuals gave dozens and dozens of hours to make these applications possible: 
- Easy AutoGUI was created by Alguimist, the founder of the Adventure IDE here https://sourceforge.net/projects/autogui/. 
- AHKv2converter was developed by https://github.com/mmikeww and https://github.com/dmtr99 among others.
- Boiler from the autohotkey.com forum, provided MessageBox Creator within the tools menu. https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=78253
- Their work served as the foundation for this project, I did very little work, just weaving the two solutions together. All the work was done by the creators just mentioned.
  
# How it works 
- Easy AutoGUI runs on ahkv1 and does not require installation; it relies on built-in executables.
- The conversion process occurs in real-time within the integrated development environment (IDE) and when selecting SaveAs/Save options.
- Cloning windows with over 1,000 lines takes less than 1 second to complete.
- Custom contingencies are in place to minimize output errors. They modify the output of ahkv2converter to suit this specific use case.
- You should never receive an error when executing code after building a GUI for ahkv2. It will happen, and please notify me of those errors, but the goal and expectation is an error-free output. 
- The function-call converts to v2 using ahkv2converter. 
- The Changes_of_note folder highlights modification made in the base code.

- Instructions: Launch from Launch_AutoGUI
- I have accounted for changes such as naming of "menubar" but there will be unforseen errors. Please notify me of those changes that need to be made in the output v2 conversion.
