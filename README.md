I did very little work, just weaving the two solutions together. All the work was done by the creators just mentioned.

- this runs Easy AutoGUI on ahkv1
- [now updates in IDE not post-save] Conversion happens when selecting "Save" or "Save as..."
- function-call converts to v2 with ahkv2converter
- custom menuhandler, and menubarhandler reduces output error for post-save initial script run
- autogui has custom code posted in the github
- works with embedded ahk exe's from ahkconverter, you do not need ahkv1 or v2, hypothetically this should run portably

I'll be adding more details here soon. Example, cloning notepad++ to ahkv2. 

I did very little work, only merging the two behemouth solutions. 

Update: Live in IDE v2 code works.

- Instructions: Launch from Launch_AutoGUI
- I have accounted for changes such as naming of "menubar" but there will be unforseen errors. Please notify me of those changes that need to be made in the output v2 conversion.
