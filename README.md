- Easy AutoGUI for AHK-v2 is a modified version of Alguimist's 'Easy AutoGUI' GUI-Designer for basic and advanced creation.
  
- If you need help, or are having trouble getting started, I put together an installer.  [Direct Link](https://github.com/samfisherirl/Easy-Auto-GUI-for-AHK-v2/releases/download/v1.6.1/Easy_AutoGUI_v2_Installer.exe)


# Credits:
This project is built upon years of hard work done by the individuals below. I played a very small part in bringing this to AHKv2, these individuals gave dozens and dozens of hours to make these applications possible: 
- Easy AutoGUI was created by **Alguimist**, the founder of the **Adventure IDE** here https://sourceforge.net/projects/autogui/. 
- AHKv2converter was developed by https://github.com/mmikeww and https://github.com/dmtr99 among others.
- Boiler from the autohotkey.com forum, provided MessageBox Creator within the tools menu. https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=78253
- Their work served as the foundation for this project, I did very little work, just weaving the two solutions together. All the work was done by the creators just mentioned.
  
# How it works 
Easy AutoGUI is built on ahkv1 and operates without requiring any installation, leveraging built-in executables.

- **Real-Time Conversion**: The process of conversion takes place in real-time within the integrated development environment (IDE).  
- **Rapid Cloning**: Cloning windows that contain over 1,000 lines is efficient, completing in less than one second.
- **Custom Contingencies**: Special measures have been implemented to reduce output errors. These adapt the ahkv2converter output to match the specific requirements of this use case.
- **Error-Free Goal**: After building a GUI for ahkv2, the expectation is that the code execution should be free of errors. While errors might occur, they are unexpected, and users should report them. The design intent is to achieve error-free output.
- **Conversion Function**: The code offers a function-call that facilitates conversion to v2 using ahkv2converter.
- **Code Modifications**: The Changes_of_note folder contains information about key modifications made to the base code, highlighting the unique aspects of the implementation.

- Instructions: Launch from Launch_AutoGUI
- I have accounted for changes such as naming of "menubar" but there will be unforseen errors. Please notify me of those changes that need to be made in the output v2 conversion.
